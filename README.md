## Rmarkdown templates

An R package containing a collection of Rmarkdown templates. Includes helpful defaults for knitr options, as well as support for in-text citations and different bibliography styles. See [here](http://pakillo.github.io/Rmarkdown_talk_SevillaR_Nov2014/) for examples.

After installing the package, click on `create new Rmarkdown document` in Rstudio
to have access to the templates. 

See http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_document_templates.html for 
more information.

Thanks to Yihui Xie, Carl Boettiger, the Rstudio team, and all the people developing and contributing to this workflow.
